# SimpleObjects

This is the project for the course _Principle of programming language_ I had taught in 2021.

I write all the Haskell code about a simple type system implementing object calculus.

Some basic features, such as stack project, unit tests and lexer/parser are involved.

For more details, see the [Readme](objects/readme.md) file in the folder.
