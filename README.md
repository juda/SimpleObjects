# SimpleObjects

This is project for the course _Principle of programming language_ I had taught in 2021.

I write all the Haskell code for such a simple type system implementing object calculus.

Some basic features, such as stack project, unit tests and lexer/parser are involved.

For more details, see the Readme file in the folder.
